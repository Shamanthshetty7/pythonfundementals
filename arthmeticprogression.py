# Arithemetic Progression
# You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference and print it.
#Sample Input:
# 1
# 3
# 5
# Sample Output:
# 2

# here we are caluculating common difference of the numbers
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
com=b-a or c-b        # logical operaters are used commonly like  'or' ,'and'  .....
print(com)


# that's it....
# lets move to next program..

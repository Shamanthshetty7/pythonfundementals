# Python is an interpreted, object-oriented,  high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
#  Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,
#  make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language...

#so...let"s begin

print("HELLO WORLD")        #if you want to print anything just use print()
print(100)                  #" " or ' ' is used inside the print() only if you wanna print character or string
a=50                        #assignment of values are simpler. just use the variable and  = and the value which you want to store(variable=value)
b="Shamanth"                #strings are used only within the " " or ' '
print(a,end=' ')            #if you dont want to give line break then just use end="spaces how much you want" 
print(b)
print("move forword to next program")

#just run it over any python ide

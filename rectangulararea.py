# Finding Rectangular Area

# You are given a rectangle in a plane. The coordinates of one of its diagonals are provided to you.
# You have to print the total area of the rectangle.
# The coordinates of the rectangle are provided as four integral values: x1, y1, x2, y2. It is given that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.

# Sample Input:
# 1
# 1
# 3
# 3
# Sample Output:
# 4

# here is your code
x1=int(input())
y1=int(input())
x2=int(input())
y2=int(input())
area=(x2-x1)*(y2-y1)   # formula of rectangular area
print(area)

# great going....

# let us move to next program..
# we will be working on conditions and loops in upcoming programs.
